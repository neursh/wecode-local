# WeCode client

The name is NO LONGER misleading, I stripped like almost everything, only the assignments feature will receive the most support. Other stuff on the site? idc. So I'd say this is the selling point-

A MORE FOCUSED WECODE. Without the annoying slow page load time. This is competitive programming, after all.

This client will only support dark theme. I don't care enough to make light theme.

## Preview
This is only a development build, the core features (template handling, code submission, languages) are still missing. This is just a show on how it would feels like to use the client.

Made with Rust in the back ðŸ«€ so you know it's good.
