I stripped like almost everything, only the assignments feature will receive the most support.

Other stuff on the site? idc.

Beautiful interface with top-tier design. Including dynamic logo stealing technology, the site's logo will appears next to the text (like this school logo).

Made with Rust ðŸ«€ so you know it's good.
