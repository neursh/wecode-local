# WeCode local

The name is rather misleading, it's only a skin over the WeCode server. I stripped like almost everything, only the assignments feature will receive the most support. Other stuff on the site? idc. So I'd say this is the selling point-

A MORE FOCUSED WECODE. Without the annoying slow page load time. This is competitive programming, after all.

Beautiful interface with top-tier design. Including dynamic logo stealing technology, the site's logo will appears next to the text (like this school logo).
